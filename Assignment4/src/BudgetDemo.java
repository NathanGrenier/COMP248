/*
* Assignment 4
* Written by: Nathan Grenier 40250986
* For COMP 248 Section T â€“ Fall 2022
* November 17, 2022 
*  
* Purpose: Driver code for HouseholdBudgets.
* The driver has a few static methods for interacting with the user: 
* - showOptions(): Prints the available commands to the console
* - promptUser(): Prompts the user for a code. Validates the code. Returns the code (int)
* - selectBudget(): Prompts the user for an index corresponding to the HouseholdBudget they want to select. 
*  					Validates the index. Returns the index (int).
* - selectExpense(): Prompts user for index of Expense they want to modify. 
* 					 Validate the index. Returns the index (int).
* 
* The driver has boilerplate code for generating funds, expenses, and budgets.
* 
* The Driver has 10 different commands whose codes correspond to the numbers below:
* 1. Displays fund and expenses of every HouseholdBudget
* 2. Displays the fund and expenses of a specific HousholdBudget
* 3. Displays the pairs of HouseholdBudgets with the same total fund value ($). No Duplicates
* 4. Displays the pairs of HouseholdBudgets with the same fund distribution. No Duplicates
* 5. Displays all HouseholdBudgets with the same total fund values and number of expenses. No duplicates
* 6. Add user specified expense to an existing HouseholdBudget
* 7. Remove a specific expense (at a certain index) from a specified HouseholdBudget
* 8. Update the due date of an expense in a specified HouseholdBudget
* 9. Add specified fund types to a HouseholdBudget's fund
* 0. Terminates the program
